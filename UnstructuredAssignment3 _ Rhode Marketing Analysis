In Task D, we used text-based features from images and captions to predict whether a post will get high or low engagement.\n","\n","We trained three separate logistic-regression models using TF-IDF features.

The third model was trained using both Image Labels and Captions combined and had an accuracy of 0.72.\n","\n","We see that the Caption-based model outperforms the Image only model which shows that language can convey emotional and promotional cues better than using Images only. Written context includes mentions, hashtags, calls-to-action, and promo wording compared to there being less diversity in just labels. Combined underperforms Captions only likely due to feature noise from Image labels as well as imbalanced feature scaling. The image labels could have introduced repetitive or generic words that added noise.

Rhode should feature models and real people using Rhode products. **Human-centered visuals** produce strong emotional responses as shown by the highest topic probabilities in the top engagement posts. Specifically, posts featuring Rhode’s founder, Hailey Bieber, consistently generate the highest engagement on the brand’s feed, showing the strong emotional and aspirational connection followers feel toward her.\n","\n","2. Rhode should **craft captions that highlight exclusivity**, novelty, and limited availability to boost engagement. Captions that emphasize the uniqueness of a product - using phrases like “limited edition,” “meet our new…,” “launching…,” “newest addition to the family,” or “seasonal favorite” - tend to generate significantly higher engagement. These expressions create anticipation and a sense of urgency, motivating followers to interact before the opportunity feels gone.
