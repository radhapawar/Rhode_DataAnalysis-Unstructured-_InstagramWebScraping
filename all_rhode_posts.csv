The first weeks and months of a child’s life play a vital role in shaping their emotional and mental well-being. When families receive meaningful support during this formative time, it can help reduce the harmful impacts of poverty, disrupt generational cycles of hardship, and foster conditions that enable children to thrive physically, mentally, and financially into adulthood.

These unconditional cash payments allow those affected to address their immediate and long-term needs, from covering the essentials to accessing long-term housing, childcare, and legal support.  Over the last month, our initial partner organizations have made significant progress in fire relief efforts, providing financial support and resources to thousands affected. As part of our plan to continue relief efforts, we’ve also expanded our partners to include five more organizations.  In addition to our $1 million commitment, throughout January and February we have reallocated our ongoing 1% of all online and upcoming pop-up sales from RFF to our LA Wildfire Relief Fund. The recovery process for our hometown will be long and ongoing, and we’re here to continue investing in organizations that provide much-needed relief."
